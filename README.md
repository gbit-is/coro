# coro
Site I created for some corona-virus math, not the best code I have written, but it works

# how does it work ?

coro.py is a scraper and it collects and parses info from worldmeters.info, be polite and don't scrape it too fast, it's not like it updates every minute or anything and creates a json file containing info on each listed country and extra math it does. the code is heavily commented and should be able to function as its own documentation 

population.txt is a text document containing world population info from wikipedia in a line seperated dsv format

index.html is a simple html frontend to display the json in an interactive table
